The goal of sbdrpdata (shark bay dolphin research project data) is to provide open access to the data collected during the ongoing long-term study of wild Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (*Tursiops aduncus*) in Shark Bay, Western Australia.

## About the data

Data were collated and made available by [Dr. Janet Mann](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RY0bAAG/janet-mann) through the [Shark Bay Dolphin Research Project](https://www.monkeymiadolphins.org), with support from the [National Science Foundation](https://nsf.gov/). 

The sbdrpdata package contains three datasets. 

```{r showdata}
library(sbdrpdata)
data(package = 'sbdrpdata')
``` 

One is called `survey_general`, and contains one row for each sighting of a group of dolphins; see `?survey_general` for more info: 

```{r example-survey_general}
head(survey_general)
```


The second dataset is `survey_dolphin`, and contains the IDs of all dolphins seen during each sighting; see `?survey_dolphin` for more info.

```{r example-survey_dolphin}
head(survey_dolphin)
```

The third dataset is `life_history`, and contains information about parentage, birth, weaning, and death dates for all individuals; see `?life_history` for more info.

```{r example-life_history}
head(life_history)
```

## Additional data use information

*NSF's Plan for Data Dissemination*: Data yielded by long-term research projects have value beyond the peer-reviewed and other publications generated by the investigators collecting the data. Other researchers may develop new perspectives on the same long-term data or new ideas may arise from a combination of long-term data sets. Also, long-term data are expected to be of special interest to the public. 

Anyone with questions regarding the data is welcome to contact [Dr. Janet Mann](https://gufaculty360.georgetown.edu/s/contact/00336000014RY0bAAG/janet-mann) about analysis and working together on any final products.
